Attributes in D&D:
	- Strength     - how hard you swing
	- Intelligence - how smart you are [mana related      - spells]
	- Dexterity    - how sneaky and athletic you are
	- Wisdom       - how smart you are [awareness related - perception, insight]
	- Constitution - how hard you can take
	- Charisma     - how well you convince others to do what you want
	
Attributes in our game:
	- Strength     - axes, swords, ...
	- Intelligence - spells
	- Dexterity    - guns, attacking speed
	- Wisdom       - avoid feeling fear & good for detective tasks, if we have them
	- Constitution - HP, recover quickly from poison, confusion, ...
	- Charisma     - good to get clues for detective tasks, if we have them

Skills:
	Idea: Like in DND, characters have skills. Those skills are activated depending on the 
	random occasion/event. When the occasion arrives, the player has a "Attribute" check. 
		(lame) Example:
		[STRENGTH] The player beats a monsters. A heavy sword is on the floor! But a new 
		monster appears and is ready to attack. 
			STRENGTH check: [random number between 0-20 + Strength of the player], if the 
			value is above XX, the player gets the sword. Otherwise, he has no time to pick it up.
		Instead of random numbers, we can have mini-games that need a certain score to be beaten,
		and the amount of points the player gains on them depends on their STRENGTH/whichever attribute.

Some events are totally random. Others depend on the player skills, that is, the event only happens
if the player has the skill in question.

Some examples below. We can discuss if you like this idea in the next meeting.

	DND: Animal Handling     - how well you control animals
	OURS: Monster "Handling" - how well you interact with (non-attacting monsters)
	
	DND:  Insight - how well you detect if someone is lying
	OURS: Insight - same, if we have people giving fake clues
